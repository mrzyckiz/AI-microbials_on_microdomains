# Designing AI-Generated Antimicrobials for Targeting Bacterial Microdomains

## Overview
This repository hosts the supplementary materials for our study on the selective binding of antimicrobial agents to bacterial membranes with distinct mechanical properties. Our work investigates how cardiolipin-rich microdomains—characterized by unique rigidity and altered lipid packing—affect antimicrobial binding and translocation energies, thus informing the rational design of targeted antimicrobial compounds.

## Abstract
> Bacterial membranes are essential structural elements that perform critical functions such as nutrient transport, signal transduction, and maintaining cellular integrity. Within these membranes, specialized microdomains—such as those enriched in cardiolipin—serve as key sites for protein localization, membrane curvature regulation, and stress response. These microdomains exhibit unique mechanical properties, including increased rigidity and altered lipid packing, which may influence the binding of antimicrobial agents. In this study, we examine the capacity of antimicrobial agents to exhibit selective activity against membranes with distinct mechanical properties. To this end, we modeled two bacterial membrane systems: one with a randomized lipid distribution and another featuring an idealized cardiolipin-rich microdomain. Using a generative neural network framework guided by specific molecular design criteria, we generated AI-driven antimicrobial candidates and evaluated them with free energy calculations. Our analysis revealed that compounds exhibited preferential binding to microdomain-containing membranes, as indicated by lower binding energies. However, the translocation-free energy was higher in these regions, likely due to the microdomains' increased rigidity. Further clustering and feature importance analysis identified recurring structural motifs associated with potent antimicrobial activity, supporting that cardiolipin-rich regions may facilitate selective binding. In parallel, a toxicity evaluation was performed, revealing that some of our candidates possess favorable toxicity profiles, a critical factor in drug discovery. By combining these approaches, we aim to enhance the rational design of antimicrobials targeting pathogenic membranes.
